## 🏗️ AI Architecture & Innovation

Koushole employs a sophisticated **Agentic AI Architecture** to deliver real-time, adaptive tutoring.

### 1. The "Socratic" Chat Tutor 🗣️
-   **Goal**: Teach, don't just solve.
-   **Flow**: `User Input` → `Orchestrator` → **Llama 4 Scout (Groq)** → `Adaptive Output`
-   **Innovation**: Uses "Peak-to-Bottom" reasoning to break down complex topics into first principles, switching seamlessly between English and Bangla.

### 2. "Pure AI" Quiz Generator 🧠
-   **Goal**: Infinite practice material.
-   **Flow**: `Subject Selection` → `JSON Schema Prompt` → **Llama 4 Scout** → `Frontend Rendering`
-   **Innovation**: Generates unique, curriculum-aligned questions on the fly without relying on static question banks.

### 3. "Diagram" Visualization Engine 🎨
-   **Goal**: Visual learning on demand.
-   **Flow**: `Intent: "Draw..."` → `Prompt Refinement` → **FLUX.1-dev (HF)** → `Visual Output`
-   **Innovation**: Instantly generates scientific diagrams within the chat interface.
